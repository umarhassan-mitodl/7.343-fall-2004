Background of Protein Misfolding and Disease
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
During the first class session, the instructor and the students will introduce themselves. The instructor will introduce the course and go over requirements and expectations outlined in the syllabus. The instructor then will present a brief lecture outlining the background and basics of protein folding, aggregation, and disease. Finally, the topic of week 2 will be introduced and the technique for week 2 will be assigned to one student.

Origins of the Protein-only Hypothesis of Prions
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Scrapie was originally observed and documented by farmers in their sheep flocks in the early 1900's. Shepards would notice a strange behavior among a few members of their flock that ultimately resulted in dementia and death. Scientists identified a transmissible element in brain from affected sheep soon afterward, although the exact composition from this "infectious" particle would remain unproven for years afterward.

Controversial Evidence against the Virus-hypothesis of Prion
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
This week we will discuss Stanley Prusiner's early work on scrapie for which he would eventually win the Nobel Prize. Although the concept of a transmissible protein element still remained unproven definitively with these articles, Prusiner and his colleagues had finally shown that material from scrapie infected mice could infect other animals.

Pathology of the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
After Prusiner's initial publications, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and kuru were soon classified as a prion diseases. Scientists began examining the brains of patients who had died from these illnesses to see if they could identify any common pathologies. This week, we will look at the plaques found in the brains of prion-infected animals.

Structure of the Prion Protein
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Prion diseases were eventually classified as protein misfolding disorders. However, a fundamental problem still remained, how are the proteins misfolded in the scrapie conformation? We will look at two studies that address the 3-dimensional conformation of the native prion protein and the infectious scrapie state using cryoEM and X-ray crystallography.

The Prion Species Barrier
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Possible one of the most remarkable mysterious of prion diseases is the relative difficult involved in transferring the scrapie form from one species to another. We will discuss how, where, and why this species barrier exists between even closely related animals.

Detection of Prion Diseases in Humans and Animals
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
One major problem in the battle against the prion diseases is that it has been exceedingly difficult to develop a reproducible, accurate detection assay for infected animals. Although a human or animal may contract a prion disease early in life, the symptoms of dementia may not be revealed until years afterward. For this reason, an infected herd of cows may be eaten by humans or used as feed long before the BSE is ever even detected. We will discuss two novel approaches to detecting the presence of the diseases.

Alzheimer's Disease
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the formation of long amyloid filaments in the brains of infected patients. These filaments are composed of varying amounts of the Aß-peptide. We will examine how the Aß-peptide is released into the neurons of Alzheimer's infected mice. We will also look at the mechanism of fiber formation of Aß identified _in vitro_ using atomic force microscopy.

Oligomeric Ring Structures in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
A relatively novel theory about Alzheimer's Aß-peptide toxicity has been introduced to the scientific community. We now think that it may not be the amyloid fiber filaments that cause neuron death and disease onset. Small oligomeric ring structures may disrupt ion concentrations in brain cells and induce cytotoxicity. This week, we will address ion fluctuations occurring during amyloidogenic neuron death and the observed structures of cytotoxic pores species.

Polyglutamine repeats in Kennedy's and Huntington's Diseases

This week, we will turn our attention to polyglutamine expansion diseases. Successive repeats of glutamine in certain proteins will cause self-association and aggregation of the molecule. We will look at the mechanism and affect of this process in Huntington's and Kennedy's disease.

Senile Systematic Amyloidosis and Inflammation
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
This week we will discuss two very different papers. First, we will examine the mechanism of transthyretin aggregation amyloid formation. This was one of the first proteins in which the amyloidogenic intermediate was identified and characterized _in vitro_ . Then, we will switch modes slightly and look at how computer modeling can be used to predict protein structure and aggregation.
